# Voting-App
Voting App is a small tutorial that builds a character voting app for EVE Online - a massively multiplayer online game.
  - ExpressJS
  - MongoDB
  - React + Flux (Alt library) as front-end framework
  - Gulp + Browserify: Bundle SASS files and Javascript files together and make them available to client-side.
  - SASS
  - Track online visitors in real-time using Socket.IO
  - Write code in ECMAScript 6 directly and use Babel to transform into ECMAScript 5 before it can be served and interpreted by the browsers.
